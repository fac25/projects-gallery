# Projects Gallery

In FAC17 [Jan](https://www.github.com/crianonim) had the wonderful idea (and initiative) to create a Project Gallery for everything that was created throughout the course. This is a fork of his original repo so that we can build on his work to create the same thing for FAC24! :smiley: Remember, this is your repo so if you want to improve on it, change the CSS, try different functionality, do it! :star:

### Guide to updating

1. Git clone the project.
2. Go to the `data.js` file and use the previous week as a template to add the current week.
3. Enter data for this week's projects. Developers' names are all defined at the bottom of `data.js`
4. If you want to save project images locally, save them at 816px x 585px in the assets folder and link as follows: `img: "assets/myPic.png"`
5. OPTIONAL: Play with the CSS! This is YOUR project gallery so make it your own! :smile:

Thanks! :sparkles:
